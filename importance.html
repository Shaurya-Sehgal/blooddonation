                <p>Everyone knows that by donating blood you save lives. But how do you save lives? Donated blood can be used in a whole range of different circumstances. Patients who were in an accident or got injured
                    and are losing blood will need a blood transfusion to aid in their recovery. Patients undergoing
                    surgical treatment will also need donated blood to replace blood lost during the surgery.</p>

                    alt="Donating Blood">
                <p>This may sound shocking to many people and they may even think it's untrue. However, donating blood does play a great role in preventing cancer. This does not mean that a donor cannot get cancer. It just means that you can lower your chances of getting cancer by donating blood regularly.</p>

                <h1>Reduces Iron Stores</h1>
                <img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/12/Donate-Blood-Save-Lives-PNG-File.png" alt="Donating Blood">
                <p>Iron stimulates the body's cells to release free radicals. These are unstable molecules that can lead to cancer and other diseases related to ageing such as diabetes. Too much iron is also linked to metabolic syndrome that is characterized by hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Studies show that many people take in more iron than their bodies actually need to maintain good health.</p>

                <h1>Burns Calories</h1>
                <img src="https://png.pngitem.com/pimgs/s/182-1822148_source-org-report-blood-donation-png-blood-transparent.png" alt="Donating Blood">
                <p>This will probably surprise you, but donating blood often helps you to burn some calories. In fact, your body can burn up to 650 calories every time you donate one pint of blood. This happens due to the process your body goes through to replace the blood plasma that is lost during the donation.</p>

                <h1>Improves Heart Health</h1>

                <p>Another surprising health benefit of donating blood regularly is the fact that it helps improve the health of your heart. Once again, high body iron stores come into play in the health of your body. High iron stores increase your risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, which is the other name for a heart attack. Therefore, by donating blood, you can reduce your risk by effectively decreasing your iron levels.</p>

                <h1>You Get Free Blood Analysis</h1>
                <img src="https://png.pngitem.com/pimgs/s/297-2970160_donating-blood-is-a-rewarding-way-to-help.png" alt="Donating Blood">
                <p>An obvious benefit to donating blood often is that you will get an up-to-date and free analysis of your blood. In addition to getting a basic health check, your blood will be checked out too. All blood must be tested for things like syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis before it can even be considered for donation. This means that labs will immediately pick up if somethingâ€™s not right. You will be informed of any problems or health issues.
