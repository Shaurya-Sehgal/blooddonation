                    ID. Then you'll complete paperwork that includes general information like your name, address, and

                        <p>Before you donate, an employee from the blood bank will ask you some confidential questions about your health and lifestyle. You'll also get a short health exam or “mini-physical.” An employee will take your pulse, blood pressure, and temperature, and take a small amount of blood for testing.</p>

                <p>When it's time to donate, here's what will happen:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        <b>(1)</b> You'll go into a donor room where you'll lie down on a cot.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>(2)</b> A phlebotomist (an employee who draws blood) will clean your arm and insert a new, sterile needle into your vein. This takes just a few seconds, and it can feel like a quick pinch.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>(3)</b> You'll donate about 1 pint (one unit) of blood. The process should take less than 10 minutes. But if you're donating platelets, red cells, or plasma by apheresis, the process can take much longer: up to 2 hours.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>(4)</b> When you're done, you'll raise your donation arm and put a little bit of pressure on it, which helps your blood clot. Then they'll put an adhesive strip on your arm.</p>

                <p>After you're finished, you'll be given snacks and a drink to help your body get back to normal since you lost some fluids. You'll want to sit and relax for at least 10 minutes to restore your strength and get some energy back before you leave.</p>
